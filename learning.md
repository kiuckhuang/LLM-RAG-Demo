# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Workflow

RAG is a technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Here's a simple workflow of how RAG works:

## 1. Document Preparation
- Collect and gather relevant documents or knowledge base
- Preprocess documents (cleaning, formatting)
- Split documents into smaller chunks for better processing
- Convert text chunks into embeddings (numerical representations)

## 2. Indexing
- Store document embeddings in a vector database
- Create searchable indexes for efficient retrieval
- Maintain metadata for each document chunk

## 3. Query Processing
- Receive user query
- Preprocess and clean the query
- Convert query into embedding using the same model used for documents

## 4. Retrieval
- Search vector database for similar embeddings
- Retrieve top-k most relevant document chunks
- Rank retrieved documents by similarity scores

## 5. Generation
- Combine user query with retrieved context
- Feed combined input to a generative language model
- Generate response based on both query and retrieved information

## 6. Post-processing
- Review and refine generated response
- Format output appropriately
- Return final response to user

## Benefits of RAG
- Provides up-to-date and factual information
- Reduces hallucination in AI responses
- Allows integration of domain-specific knowledge
- Maintains conversational flow while ensuring accuracy
